/**
 * 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
 *
 * A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
 *
 * The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].
 * Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights).
 * We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
 *
 * Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
 *
 * Note:
 *  * 1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
 *  * 1 <= weights[i] <= 500
