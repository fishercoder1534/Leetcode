 * 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
 *
 * Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [5,7]
 * Output: 4
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [0,1]
 * Output: 0

         * e.g. 5 and 7, in binary, they are 101 and 111, the result for [5,7] is 5&6&7 which is 101&110&111
         * this we can understand it to be shifting the digits of m and n from left to right until they become the same, then we pad that number with zeroes on the right side
