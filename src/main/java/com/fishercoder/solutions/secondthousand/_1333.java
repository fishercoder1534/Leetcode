 * 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance
 *
 * Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei].
 * You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.
 * The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with
 * veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant).
 * In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value
 * for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.
 * Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest.
 * For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest.
 * For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
 * Output: [3,1,5]
 * Explanation:
 * The restaurants are:
 * Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
 * Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
 * Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
 * Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
 * Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1]
 * After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
 * Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
 * Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3
 * Output: [4,5]
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4
 * restaurants[i].length == 5
 * 1 <= idi, ratingi, pricei, distancei <= 10^5
 * 1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5
 * veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly are 0 or 1.
 * All idi are distinct.
