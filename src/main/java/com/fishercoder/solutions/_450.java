         * Steps:
         * 1. Recursively find the node that has the same value as the key, while setting the left/right nodes equal to the returned subtree
         * 2. Once the node is found, have to handle the below 4 cases
         * a. node doesn't have left or right - return null
         * b. node only has left subtree- return the left subtree
         * c. node only has right subtree- return the right subtree
         * d. node has both left and right - find the minimum value in the right subtree, set that value to the currently found node, then recursively delete the minimum value in the right subtree

         * Again, using a pen and paper to visualize helps a lot.
         * Putting a BST into an inorder traversal array helps a lot to understand:
         *
         * The successor of a node is always: go the right once, and then go to the left as many times as possibleï¼Œ
         * because the successor is the next smallest element that is larger than the current one: so going to the right one time
         * makes sure that we are finding the larger one, and then keeping going to the left makes sure that we'll find the smallest one.
         *
         * The predecessor of a node is always: go the left once, and then go the right as many times as possible,
         * because the predecessor is the largest element that is smaller than the current one: so going to the left once makes it smaller than the current node,
         * then keeping going to the right makes sure that we are getting the largest element.
