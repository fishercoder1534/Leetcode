/**
 * 657. Judge Route Circle
 *
 * Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0).
 * Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle,
 * which means it moves back to the original place.

 The move sequence is represented by a string.
 And each move is represent by a character.
 The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down).
 The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

 Example 1:
 Input: "UD"
 Output: true

 Example 2:
 Input: "LL"
 Output: false
