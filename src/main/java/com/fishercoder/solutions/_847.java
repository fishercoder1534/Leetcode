/**
 * 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes
 *
 * An undirected, connected graph of N nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1) is given as graph.
 * graph.length = N, and j != i is in the list graph[i] exactly once, if and only if nodes i and j are connected.
 * Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node.
 * You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
 *
 * Note:
 * 1 <= graph.length <= 12
 * 0 <= graph[i].length < graph.length
 * */
