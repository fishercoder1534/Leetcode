/**
 * 888. Fair Candy Swap
 *
 * Alice and Bob have candy bars of different sizes: A[i] is the size of the i-th bar of candy that Alice has, and B[j]
 * is the size of the j-th bar of candy that Bob has.
 *
 * Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy bar each so that after the exchange, they both have the
 * same total amount of candy.  (The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the sizes of candy bars they have.)
 *
 * Return an integer array ans where ans[0] is the size of the candy bar that Alice must exchange, and ans[1] is the
 * size of the candy bar that Bob must exchange.
 *
 * If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,1], B = [2,2]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,2], B = [2,3]
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: A = [2], B = [1,3]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: A = [1,2,5], B = [2,4]
 * Output: [5,4]
