/**
 * 564. Find the Closest Palindrome
 *
 * Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

 The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

 Example 1:

 Input: "123"
 Output: "121"

 Note:

 The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
 If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
