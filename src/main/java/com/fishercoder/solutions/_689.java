/**
 * 689. Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays
 *
 * In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.
 * Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k entries.
 * Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed).
 * If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

 Example:
 Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
 Output: [0, 3, 5]
 Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
 We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.

 Note:
 nums.length will be between 1 and 20000.
 nums[i] will be between 1 and 65535.
 k will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).
