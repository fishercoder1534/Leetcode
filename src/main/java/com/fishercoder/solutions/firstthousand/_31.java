         * Leetcode has a very good article to illustrate this problem and with animation:
         * https://leetcode.com/articles/next-permutation/
         * 1. if the array is already in decrementing order, then there's no next larger permutation possible.
         * 2. if not, start from the end of the array, find the first pair of numbers that break the decrementing order
         * 3. then from that index going to the right again, find the element that is closest bigger than this number, swap them
         * 4. reverse the right half of this array after this index to make it sorted increasingly so that it's the next permutation
         * <p>
         * Use this nums as an example: 1,2,5,4,3
         * 1. we first found such an adjacent pair: 2 and 5 that breaks the decrementing order;
         * 2. then starting from the right side again, we find a number that's bigger than 2, so that is 3, swap them, the array becomes: 1,3,5,4,2
         * 3. reverse this sub-array: 5,4,2 since they are guaranteed to be decreasing order, so reversing them will give us the next permutation: 1,3,2,4,5
