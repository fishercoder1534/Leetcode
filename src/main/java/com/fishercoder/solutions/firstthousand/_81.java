/*
 * 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
 * <p>
 * There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
 * Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is
 * [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
 * Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.
 * You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: true
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: false
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 * -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 * nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
 * -104 <= target <= 104
 * Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
