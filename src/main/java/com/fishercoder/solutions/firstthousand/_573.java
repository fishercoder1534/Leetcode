         * 1. The order in which to pick the nuts does not matter except the first one
         * because for all the other nuts, the squirrel needs to travel back and forth.
         * <p>
         * 2. For the first nut to be picked, there's some distance we might be able to save, what is this distance?
         * It is the difference between the squirrel's original starting point to the first nut and that the distance from this
         * first nut to the tree.
         * This is because, only for the first nut, the squirrel does NOT need to travel back and forth, it only needs to travel from
         * its starting position to the nut position and then return to the tree.
         * <p>
         * 3. For the rest of all other nuts, the squirrel always needs to go back and forth.
         * <p>
         * 4. So how can we find the first nut to go to so that we could have the maximum saved distance?
         * We iterate through all of the nuts and keep updating the savedDist as below:
