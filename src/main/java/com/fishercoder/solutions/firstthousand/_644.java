    /*
     * To understand the idea behind this method, let's look at the following points.
     * Firstly, we know that the value of the average could lie between the range (min, max)(min,max).
     * Here, minmin and maxmax refer to the minimum and the maximum values out of the given numsnums array.
     * This is because, the average can't be lesser than the minimum value and can't be larger than the maximum value.
     * But, in this case, we need to find the maximum average of a subarray with atleast kk elements.
     * The idea in this method is to try to approximate(guess) the solution and to try to find if this solution really exists.
     * If it exists, we can continue trying to approximate the solution even to a further precise value,
     * but choosing a larger number as the next approximation.
     * But, if the initial guess is wrong, and the initial maximum average value(guessed) isn't possible,
     * we need to try with a smaller number as the next approximate.
     * <p>
     * Now, instead of doing the guesses randomly, we can make use of Binary Search.
     * With minmin and maxmax as the initial numbers to begin with,
     * we can find out the midmid of these two numbers given by (min+max)/2(min+max)/2.
     * Now, we need to find if a subarray with length greater than or equal to kk is possible with an average sum greater than this midmid value.
