         * Mental gymnastics (which is explained step by step in the above link):
         * 1. picture this to be a ball throwing onto a line from the starting point (0,0);
         * 2. where this ball is going to land on the line is a probability problem, i.e. an offset to the starting point (0,0);
         * 3. we can use prefix sums array to simulate this line (each value in the array is positive as it represents the weight/probability of it being picked, so cannot be zero or negative);
         * 4. we can use Random() to generate a random number called index bounded by the last value of the prefix sums array, i.e. the biggest offset possible;
         * 5. then we can use binary search to find where this random number: index, would fit in the prefix sums array.
