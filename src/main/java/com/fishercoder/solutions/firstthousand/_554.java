         * <p>
         * we make use of a HashMap
         * map which is used to store entries in the form:
         * (sum,count). Here,
         * sum refers to the cumulative sum of the bricks' widths encountered in the current row, and
         * count refers to the number of times the corresponding sum is obtained. Thus,
         * sum in a way, represents the positions of the bricks's boundaries relative to the leftmost boundary.
         * <p>
         * This is done based on the following observation:
         * We will never obtain the same value of sum twice while traversing over a particular row.
         * Thus, if the sum value is repeated while traversing over the rows, it means some row's brick boundary coincides with some previous row's brick boundary.
         * This fact is accounted for by incrementing the corresponding count value.
         * But, for every row, we consider the sum only upto the second last brick, since the last boundary isn't a valid boundary for the solution.
