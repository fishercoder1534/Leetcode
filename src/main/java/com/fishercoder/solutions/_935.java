/**
 * A chess knight can move as indicated in the chess diagram below:
 *
 * https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png
 *
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 | 2 | 3 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 4 | 5 | 6 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 7 | 8 | 9 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | x | 0 | x |
 * |---|---|---|
 *
 * This time, we place our chess knight on any numbered key of a phone pad (indicated above), and the knight makes N-1 hops.
 * Each hop must be from one key to another numbered key.
 *
 * Each time it lands on a key (including the initial placement of the knight), it presses the number of that key, pressing N digits total.
 *
 * How many distinct numbers can you dial in this manner?
 *
 * Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Note:
 *  * 1 <= N <= 5000

     * The intuition is to calculate the number of ways
     * we can reach a key k after i hops, based on the number of ways we can reach keys x after i-1 hops
     * s.t. the knight can move from x to k in one move
     * For example,
     * We can reach 6 in 3 ways after 1 hop (1 -> 6, 7 -> 6 or 0 -> 6)
     * We can reach 8 in 2 ways after 1 hop (1 -> 8 or 3 -> 8)
     * Thus, we can reach 1 in 5 ways after 2 hops:
     * . 1. 1 -> 6 -> 1
     * . 2. 7 -> 6 -> 1
     * . 3. 0 -> 6 -> 1
     *   4. 1 -> 8 -> 1
     *   5. 3 -> 8 -> 1
